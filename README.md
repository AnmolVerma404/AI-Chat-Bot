# Chat Bot

This is a chatbot that uses OpenAI API to generate responses to user inputs. It is similar to ChatGPT, a chatbot trained on a large dataset of human conversations.

## How it works

The chatbot uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user inputs. It takes in user input and uses the API to generate a response based on the input. The API uses machine learning algorithms to generate the responses, which allows the chatbot to hold natural and coherent conversations with users.

## Features

- Natural and coherent conversations: The chatbot is able to hold natural and coherent conversations with users thanks to the powerful machine learning algorithms used by the OpenAI API.

- Customizable responses: The chatbot can be customized to generate specific responses for certain inputs. For example, you can train the chatbot to generate a specific response when the user inputs a certain keyword.

- Easy to use: The chatbot is easy to use, simply send a message to the chatbot and it will generate a response.

## Requirements

- An OpenAI API key: To use the chatbot, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for a free API key at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/)

## Running the chatbot

- Fork/clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AnmolVerma404/AI-Chat-Bot.git
```

- Install the required libraries in the client and server folders:

```
npm install
```

- Create your own free API Key on [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

- Copy the API key, create a .env file in the server folder, and paste it there. For reference see .example.env

- Run the frontend of our application on different terminals `cd .\client\` and `npm run dev`
- Also run the server be `cd .\server\` and `npm run server`

- Now ask this bot your questions?ðŸ¤”
